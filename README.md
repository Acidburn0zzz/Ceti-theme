Important

The GTK3 theme supports Gnome 3.8, 3.10 and 3.12, but the Gnome Shell theme only works on 3.10 and 3.12. Also the tabs you are seeing in nautilus, gedit, etc. are only for Gnome 3.12 due to the reworked tab system in this version.

A Chrome/Chromium theme is included.

Requirements

gnome-themes-standard package for the GTK3 theme. Murrine and pixbuf engines for the GTK2 theme.

For installation instructions please read the included README.
