###########################

* Gnome/GTK 3.8, 3.10 or 3.12
* GTK3: gnome-themes-standard package or a package which contains the adwaita engine
* GTK2: Murrine engine and pixbuf engine

Please search in the repositories of your distribution because the package names vary from distro to distro.


###########################
#      Installation       #
###########################

The extracted zip file contains three different subfolders ("Gnome_3-8_Ubuntu_13-10", "Gnome_3-10_Ubuntu_14-04" and "Gnome_3-12") with the GTK themes for the different versions of Gnome/GTK. Pick the one that matches your version and copy the contents to "/usr/share/themes".
Note: there is currently no Gnome-Shell theme for Gnome 3.8.

To set the theme, run the following commands in Terminal,

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Ceti"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Ceti"

or just use gnome-tweak-tool

For Gnome 3.8 and 3.10 you will need a fitting icon for the header-bar close button. Find the "window-close-symbolic.png" or "window-close-symbolic.svg" file in your icon theme and replace it with the one you find in the extracted zip file.

The above step is not necessary with Gnome 3.12!

To install the Chrome/Chromium theme open the "Chrome" folder in the extracted archive and drag and drop the Ceti.crx file into the Chrome/Chromium window.

#   Troubleshooting   #
#######################

If you get black spaces under Unity, disable overlay scrollbars with

gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal


If the metacity theme doesn't show up in gnome-tweak-tool copy the theme folder with only the metacity theme inside to ~/.local/share/themes. Otherwise gnome-tweak-tool won't find the metacity theme. (This shouldn't happen if you copy the theme to /usr/share/themes)
